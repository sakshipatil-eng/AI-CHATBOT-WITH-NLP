🤖 AI Chatbot Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project is a simple AI chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The chatbot responds to user queries by finding the most similar sentence from a predefined knowledge corpus using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.


🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate how NLP techniques can be used to build a basic conversational chatbot capable of:

Understanding user input

Responding with relevant answers

Handling greetings and exit commands


✨ Features

Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK

Text similarity using TF-IDF Vectorizer

Response selection using Cosine Similarity

Greeting detection

Interactive command-line chatbot


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn

NumPy


📂 Project Structure

aichatbot.py

README.md


⚙️ Requirements

Make sure Python 3.x is installed.

Install required libraries:

pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn

Download NLTK resources (run once):

import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')


▶️ How to Run the Chatbot

Open terminal / command prompt

Navigate to the project folder

Run the file:

python aichatbot.py


💬 How It Works

User enters a message

Text is preprocessed (tokenization & lemmatization)

TF-IDF vectors are generated

Cosine similarity is calculated

The most relevant response is returned from the corpus


🧠 Knowledge Base

The chatbot uses a predefined corpus containing information about:

Greetings

Python programming

Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning

Natural Language Processing


🛑 Exit Condition

Type:

exit

to stop the chatbot.


🚀 Future Enhancements

Expand knowledge base

Add GUI or web interface

Use deep learning models

Store conversation history

Support multiple languages
